# Vue 3 + Vite + Pinia

This is my learning about using vue with pinia for state management. According to the pinia website official, this state management **extremely light** than vuex. Using the pinia is simple, there is no more called mutations for life cycle of state management like vuex. It's just about state, getters and actions. For any further information, we can visit the documentation of pinia in https://pinia.vuejs.org/
